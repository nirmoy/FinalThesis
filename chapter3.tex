\section{Overview}
  \paragraph\
    In this chapter I describe about \emph{ntop}, Cassandra and implementation of Cassandra plugin for \emph{ntop}.
    I also specify design and implementation of Cassandra client for C that developed using C-python API. I have done few 
    testing of my solution that I describe in results section. 
    
  \section{\emph{ntop}}
  \emph{ntop} is open-source traffic measurement application written in C. \emph{ntop} design follow UNIX philosophy:
  applications can be divided into small independent pieces that co-operate to achieve a common goal.
  \emph{ntop} has following module
    \begin{enumerate}
     \item Packet Sniffer - Capture packet using \emph{libpcap} library and also from UNIX sockets.
     \item Packet Analyzer - Analyze packets captured by Packet Sniffer.
     \item Traffic Rules - \emph{ntop} allows traffic rules for capturing packets to filter out unnecessary packets.
     \item Report Engine - Report Engine display analyzed output in an interactive web-based user interface. 
     \item Plugins - Using plugins anyone can extend \emph{ntop} to support extra features.
    \end{enumerate}
    
     \subsection{Packet Sniffer}
      \paragraph\
	Packet Sniffer captures packet using \emph{libpcap} library and store them into internal buffer, that helps to reduce packet drops
	in a busty traffic environment. \emph{libpcap} is supported by all major Operating Systems, that allows \emph{ntop} to be 
	portable to windows and UNIX variants.

          \caption{Architecture of \emph{ntop}.} 
        \end{figure}
	\subsection{Packet Analyzer}
	 \paragraph\
	 Packet Analyzer gets packets from Packet Sniffer and process those packets. Sniffed packets contained 
	 information about status of network and that information calculated by Packet Analyzer then stored in 
	 RRD for future references.
	\subsection{Traffic Rules}
	\paragraph\
	  \emph{ntop} allows user to specify what kind traffic a user is interested. Using \emph{libpcap} filter expression 
	  \emph{ntop} achieve this goal. Traffic Rules helps \emph{ntop} to reduce some burden on memory as well CPU, makes \emph{ntop}
	  more faster as it process less amount of packets.
	\subsection{Report Engine}
	\paragraph\
	  \emph{ntop} contains a web-server by which user from any geological location can monitor their network.
	  Report Engine provides a beautiful user interface with time series graph drawn using RRDTool. Using Report Engine
	  a user can change behavior of \emph{ntop} by changing its configuration parameters.
	\subsection{Plugins}
	 \paragraph\
	 \emph{ntop} has flexible design that allows user to add their own plugins. At startup \emph{ntop}
	 searches shared libraries (like .so, .dll files) to load  plugins. A plugin can access \emph{ntop}'s global 
	 data structure and can use API exported by \emph{ntop}.

      \section{Cassandra Database}
      \paragraph\
      Cassandra is a highly scalable and highly available database initially developed by Facebook using 
      two famous approach GFS\cite{gfs}  from Google and Dynamo\cite{dynamo} from Amazon. Cassandra currently highly
      used in ebay and Netflix. 
      Cassandra's big data features are 
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item Elastic scalability.
       \item High availability.
       \item Distributed database design with no single point of failure.
       \item Blistering linear performance.
       \item Multiple datacenter based data distribution.
      \end{enumerate}
      \paragraph{Why Cassandra:} In one of our testbed we are able to generate approx 1000 NetFlow packets per second with only two node
      having 1 Gbps NIC card. Bellow table provides amount of data generated by our testbed.\\
      \begin{tabular}{ccc}
      \\
      \hline
	  Packets generated& Time & Size of generated data \\
	  \hline
	  1000   & 1 second & 1.4MB\\
	  60 k   & 1 minute & 85 MB\\
	  3.6 m  & 1 hour    &  5 GB\\
      \end{tabular}\\
      It is clear that we can't use RDMS based databases for storing flow in data center network which can create explosive amount of
      data in short time. So for Flow monitoring a database should have following features:
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item Scalability : So that huge amount of data can be stored according to the demand.
       \item High write throughput : As flow records generate at rapid speed in data center network, flow monitoring system needs  to write
	     them fast.
       \item Reasonable read performance : For real-time flow processing.
       \item MapReduce support: For offline flow processing needs MapReduce for massive data crunching operation.
      \end{enumerate}
      
      Here is list of nosql databases that I have reviewed.
      
      \paragraph{Redis:} Redis is written in C. It has fast read-write performance but not scalable. Redis cluster
      going to lunch by end of 2013\cite{rrdcluster}, but for now it is out of consideration. 
      \paragraph{HBase:} HBase is written in Java . It is scalable, good read write performance but suitable for
      batch processing. It has single point of failure with Hadoop NameNode for which HBase may lose data  .  
      \paragraph{Cassandra:} Cassandra meet all the requirements that needed.

      \section{Cassandra C Client}
      \paragraph\
      Cassandra C client is a wrapper around Cassandra Python client that is Pycassa. I used C-Python API
      to write wrapper around Python's Pycassa API. Pycassa use Thrift RPC call to communicate with Cassandra.
      Figure 2.3 describe how C client API call finally reach to Cassandra. Cassandra C client API has three major 
      classes of APIs, these are 
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item Schema Manipulation API: Manage schema definitions of Cassandra.
       \item Data Manipulation API: Insert or retrieve data from Cassandra. 
       \item Utility API:  API do some common useful work. 
      \end{enumerate}

      \begin{figure}[htb]
	 \centering
         \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{C_client.eps}
         \caption{API interaction with Cassandra }
      \end{figure}
      

      \subsection{Schema Manipulation API}
      \paragraph\
      These API allows one to create or delete keyspace and column families. 
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item {\bf cassandraCreateKeyspace}(name, server, rf, strategy): Create keyspace on the server with replication factor(rf) and strategy.
	    Supported strategies are 
	     \begin{enumerate}
	      \item SimpleStrategy : Replication strategy that simply chooses consecutive nodes in the ring for replicas.
	      \item NetworkTopologyStrategy : Replication strategy that puts a number of replicas in each datacenter.
	      \item OldNetworkTopologyStrategy : Same as NetworkTopologyStrategy with few limitations that solved in NetworkTopologyStrategy.
	     \end{enumerate}

       \item {\bf cassandraCreateColumnFamily}(name, keyspace, comparator, server): create column family on the keyspace with given comparator. 
	      Supported comparators are 
		    \begin{enumerate}
		     \item AsciiType
		     \item DoubleType
		     \item IntegerType
		     \item BytesType
		     \item LongType
		     \item FloatType
		     \item TimeUUIDType
		    \end{enumerate}
      \item {\bf cassandraDropColumnFamily}(name, keyspace, server): Delete column family from keyspace.
      \item {\bf cassandraDropKeyspace}(name, server): Delete keyspace from the server.
      \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Data Manipulation API}
    \paragraph\
    These API deal with insertion and retrieval of data from Cassandra server.
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item {\bf cassandraConnect}(keyspace, columnfamily, server): Create a connection and store connection object in 
	      internal Python dictionary for later use. As connection creation takes time, connection objects are cached in
	      Python dictionary.
       \item {\bf cassandraInsert}(id, key, value, column name): Insert a key-value pair in column family referred by id.
       \item {\bf cassandraGet}(id, key): Return a dictionary of key-value pair from  column family referred by id.
       \item {\bf cassandraGetItem}(dictionary, position, name, value): Return a column name and value from the dictionary's 
	      specified by position.  
      \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Utility API}
    \paragraph\
    These APIs provide general functionality that we need in general use.
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item {\bf isExistPycassa}(): Check existence of pycassa on the system.
       \item {\bf isExistKeyspace}(name ,server): Check existence of keyspace on the server.
       \item {\bf isExistColumnfamily}(name, keyspace,server): Check existence of columnfamily on the keyspace. 
      \end{enumerate}

      \section{Cassandra Plugin for \emph{ntop}}
      Cassandra Plugin is developed in C as shared object. \emph{ntop} uses  shared objects principle to provide plug-in, 
      that allows dynamic linking of compiled shared objects  to \emph{ntop} to add extra features.

      \textbf{\emph{ntop} support following API for plugin support:}\\
     
     \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
	\hline
	\textbf{API name} &  \textbf{Details}\\
	\hline
	int(*IntFunct)(void); & Called at initialization of the plugin.\\
	\hline
	void(*VoidFunct)(u\_char); & Called at termination of the plugin.\\
	\hline
	void(*PluginHTTPFunct)(char* url); & HTTP request handler function.\\
	\hline
      \end{tabular}
      
      
      \paragraph{API of Cassandra Plugin:}In the bellow table I describe APIs that I wrote for
      Cassandra Plugin for \emph{ntop}.\\
      
      
      \begin{enumerate}
       \item {\bf initCassandraFunct } (void): Initialize Cassandra Plugin. It check for pycassa module, 
	      availability of Cassandra server then invokes cassandraMainLoop.
       \item {\bf termCassandraFunct} (u\_char termNtop): Terminate Cassandra Plugin.
       \item {\bf handlecassandraHTTPrequest} (char *\_url): It gets web request from web browser and serves them.\\
       \item {\bf cassandraMainLoop}(void) : This API does all major work described in bellow.
	      \begin{enumerate}
	      \item Read configuration file and initialize data structure needed to store data.
	       \item Identify sniffed interface, gets statistics from global variable and store into Cassandra.
	       \item Identify NetFlow socket, gets data from global variable and store them to Cassandra. 
	      \end{enumerate}
      \end{enumerate}
